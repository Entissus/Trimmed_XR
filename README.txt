There are vestilgial remants from MacBain81's original work. 
The major of these are leftovers for jobs of the remaining ships along with some items that I am unsure if can be deleted without things going FUBAR

I did not create any of these models nor did I do the hard work to import than and update them for the 6.0 engine.
All credits to those who got XRShips updated to 6.0
