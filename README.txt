I have integrated VRO internal shields, turret options, and gave the ships a balance pass to better fit VRO. Overall they will be a little slower and less agile, slightly reduced cargoholds, increased hull, a large boost to their overall shield HP and recharge rate, and finally their drones, deployabes, and countermeasures were brought in line with VRO standards. The original VRO versions of these ship only had the internal shields added and a ~50% increase in hull; no other stats had really been VRO adjusted and they were really standing out against VRO ships, in my opinion.

I only updated the generic stats with the Arawn and Taranis. A friend requested they be apart of this so that is why they are present.

As a note for the Terran ships: I do have some ideas for them and I am looking to replace their textures with Terran ones -- but as it stands right now: 
*The Secullus is balanced around being a "pocket battleship" it has roughly half the hull/shields than an Asgard but packs a big punch with the weapons but is lacking in the turret department. I wanted to try and give an alternative playstyle for choice.

* The Klendathu is balanced around being an alternative to the Syn. I gave it the option to fit a PSP in the turret slot but.. this ship could maybe use some more tweaks as I am unsure if it truly is an alternative due to the lack of more Large Turrets. Suggestions would be very welcomed.

* The Centurion.. is the bane of my existence. This ship has been an utter nightmare from beginning to end. Balancing this was "fun" and I'm still not fully sold on it. Originally it was going to be an alternative to the Osaka but, much like the Klendathu, it just could never add up. I did remove 4 Medium Turrets from it so maybe these need to be added back. I changed this from a Destroyer class to a VRO Frigate class -- a heavy one. It sits somewhere between the different designations but it is an odd duck in the Frigate class

* The Mirages work but I had to do some trickery to successfully get cargo drones on them and I'm unsure if they will be a problem in-sector. A BIG DISCLAIMER. These are the only ships which do __NOT__ have an XS docking port so they are not player-suit friendly.
