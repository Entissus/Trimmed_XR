There are still some vestilgial remants from MacBain81's original work with the majority of these are leftovers for potential texture assets for ships that I think are removed but..  I wasn't too adventurous with removing those parts. 

I did not create any of these models nor did I do the hard work to import and then update them for the 6.0 engine.
All credits to those who got XRShips updated to 6.0

I am currently working on the "Terran" ships which is why they are even apart of this still, they are fully functional just.. not ready to show their changes
