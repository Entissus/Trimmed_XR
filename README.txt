I have also integrated VRO internal shields, turret options, and gave the ships a balance pass to better fit VRO. Overall they will be a little slower and less agile, slightly reduced cargoholds, increased hull, a large boost to their overall shield HP and recharge rate, and finally their drones, deployabes, and countermeasures were brought in line with VRO standards. The original VRO versions of these ship only had the internal shields added and a ~50% increase in hull; no other stats had been balanced and they were really standing out against VRO ships

There are still some leftover bits from the original XR_Ships but I have tried to prune out all irrelevant and unused code/files. If you find an error, something breaks, or have any suggests please let me know. I am not opposed to reintroducing ships but I am trying to really cut a lot of the bloat/redundant ships even if some do look really cool.
