I have also integrated VRO internal shields, turret options, and gave the ships a balance pass to better fit VRO. Overall they will be a little slower and less agile, slightly reduced cargoholds, increased hull, a large boost to their overall shield HP and recharge rate, and finally their drones, deployabes, and countermeasures were brought in line with VRO standards. The original VRO versions of these ship only had the internal shields added and a ~50% increase in hull; no other stats had been balanced and they were really standing out against VRO ships

There are still some leftover bits from the original XR_Ships but I have tried to prune out all irrelevant and unused code/files. If you find an error, something breaks, or have any suggests please let me know. I am not opposed to reintroducing ships but I am trying to really cut a lot of the bloat/redundant ships even if some do look really cool.

I only updated the generic stats with the Arawn and Taranis. A friend requested they be apart of this so that is why they are present.

As a note for the Terran ships: I do have some ideas for them and I am looking to replace their textures with Terran ones -- but as it stands right now: 
The Secullus is balanced around being a "pocket battleship" it has roughly half the hull/shields than an Asgard but packs a big punch with the weapons but is lacking in the turret department. I wanted to try and give an alternative playstyle for choice.

The Klendathu is balanced around being an alternative to the Syn. I gave it the option to fit a PSP in the turret slot but.. this ship will likely need to be downgraded since I don't believe it could stand toe-to-toe with a Syn. Suggestions would be very welcomed.

The Centurion.. ah the bane of my existance. This ship has been an utter nightmare from beginning to end. Balancing this was "fun" and I'm still not fully sold on it. Originally it was going to be an alternative to the Osaka but, much like the Klendathu, it just could never add up. So I changed this into a VRO Frigate class -- a heavy one at that. It sits somewhere between the different designations.
